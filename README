This  directory  contains  source  code  for  Bracy  (pronounced  bray-see),  a
minimalist document compiler that produces  HTML files. It also contains source
code for Bracx (pronounced bray-sex),  a cross reference generator for links in
Bracy  source files.  Most of  the documentation  for Orson  was  composed with
Bracy, and debugged  with Bracx. The following files  contain Orson source code
