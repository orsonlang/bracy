!  Bracy is a simple document compiler. It outputs HTML files that are supposed
!  to look like printed pages. It doesn't always succeed, because most browsers
!  aren't good at rendering text, but it gets as close as it can. It also tries
!  to make HTML that Humans can read, so you can edit a file made by Bracy even
!  if you don't have the Bracy source for it.
